"""
Manages the application's data layer, including in-memory state and SQLite persistence.

This module defines `WidgetState`, which acts as the main interface for the application's
data, and `DatabaseWorker`, a dedicated QThread for all database write and maintenance
operations to ensure the UI remains responsive.

Key Features:
- Manages an in-memory deque of recent speeds for the real-time mini-graph.
- Stores granular, per-interface network speed data in a multi-tiered SQLite database.
- Implements a multi-tier aggregation strategy:
  - Per-second data is kept for 24 hours.
  - Per-minute aggregates are kept for 30 days.
  - Per-hour aggregates are kept for up to 1 year.
- Handles user-configurable data retention with a 48-hour grace period for reductions.
- Performs all database writes and maintenance (pruning, aggregation, VACUUM) in a
  dedicated background thread to prevent UI blocking.
- Guarantees data integrity through the use of atomic transactions.
