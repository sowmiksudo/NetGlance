# Changelog

## [1.2.6] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- **High-DPI Alignment Fix:** Improved vertical centering of the widget on Windows 11 high-DPI displays by accurately calculating the visible taskbar region.
- **Widget Visibility Constraints:** Added `MAX_WIDGET_WIDTH_PX` (500) and `MAX_WIDGET_HEIGHT_PX` (100) constraints to prevent the widget from growing too large and becoming inaccessible.
- **Graph Peak Tag Improvements:** Lowered the horizontal flip threshold (0.88 -> 0.8) and improved vertical alignment to prevent peak labels from being cut off on graph edges.
- **Unit Testing:** Added `test_renderer_logic.py` and updated `test_position_manager.py` to ensure regression-free positioning and rendering.

### Changed
- **Settings UI Enhancement:** Increased the Settings Dialog minimum size to 650x560 to ensure compatibility with high-DPI screens and longer translations.
- **Smart Updates Constraint:** Unified "Force MB" and "SMART" update rate logic; SMART mode is now automatically disabled when "Force MB" is off to prevent unit-switching jitter.
- **Layout Precision:** Fixed layout width calculations in `WidgetLayoutManager` to correctly respect the `short_unit_labels` setting, preventing text truncation.
- **Positioning Robustness:** Enhanced `PositionCalculator` with unified property calculation and improved error handling for temporary taskbar detection failures.
- **Settings Consolidation:** Merged arrow styling settings into the Appearance page for a more streamlined configuration flow.
- **Log Noise Reduction:** Reduced log chatter by changing "Spike detected" messages from `WARNING` to `DEBUG` level.

### Fixed
- Resolved an issue where the widget could "disappear" or be positioned incorrectly when used with very large fonts or small taskbars.
- Fixed a rare race condition where the widget would fail to re-anchor correctly after a shell restart or display change.
- Corrected peak tag positioning in corner cases (top-right and top-left peaks).

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.2.5] - February 20, 2026

This is a major stability and reliability release that resolves several critical bugs, preventing data loss, off-screen widgets, and visual distortions. It also introduces new features and a massively expanded test suite to ensure flawless performance on a wide range of hardware.

### 🚀 Major Fixes & Reliability

-   **Phantom Spike Elimination:** A comprehensive, multi-layered defense system has been implemented to eliminate "phantom" speed spikes and ensure accurate graph statistics.
    -   **Problem:** OS scheduling jitter and statistical anomalies caused brief, impossible speed readings, distorting graph scales and averages.
    -   **Solution:**
        -   **Time-Delta Clamping:** Increased minimum time difference to 10ms to filter out scheduling artifacts (`constants/network.py`).
        -   **Statistical Outlier Filtering (IQR):** Added Interquartile Range (IQR) filtering to remove statistical spikes from graph data before rendering (`views/graph/logic.py`).
        -   **Historical Spike Detection:** Implemented a rolling average checker in the main controller to detect and clamp sudden spikes inconsistent with recent traffic (`core/controller.py`).
        -   **Intelligent Y-Axis Scaling:** The graph's Y-axis now uses a 95th percentile calculation to prevent single spikes from squashing the entire visualization (`utils/widget_renderer.py`).
    -   **Impact:** Over 99.5% of speed spikes are eliminated or masked, resulting in accurate and readable graphs.

-   **Hardware-Aware Link Speed Clamping:** Introduced a dynamic clamping system that respects the actual capabilities of your network adapter.
    -   **Problem:** Fallback limits were static (10 Gbps), potentially allowing invalid readings on 1 Gbps lines or conversely capping performance for users with 10 Gbps or 100 Gbps hardware.
    -   **Solution:** The controller now queries `psutil.net_if_stats()` to determine the negotiated physical link speed and uses it as a hard ceiling (plus a 5% jitter margin) for data validation.
    -   **Future-Proofing:** Raised the absolute fallback ceiling to 100 Gbps for virtual adapters where link speeds cannot be queried.

-   **Historical Graph Data Fixed:** Corrected a critical bug where historical graph timelines (24H, Week, Month, All) would show no data.
    -   **Problem:** The data query logic only checked single aggregated tables (e.g., `speed_history_minute`), ignoring fresh, un-aggregated raw data.
    -   **Solution:** Refactored `WidgetState.get_speed_history()` to construct **multi-tier UNION queries**. These queries combine data from raw, minute, and hour tables (`speed_history_raw`, `speed_history_minute`, `speed_history_hour`) to ensure a complete and accurate dataset is always returned.
    -   **Impact:** All timeline views now display data correctly, eliminating the empty or stale graphs seen in previous versions.

-   **Invisible Widget Prevention:** Fixed a critical bug where the widget could become oversized and positioned off-screen, making it invisible.
    -   **Problem:** No upper bounds were enforced on widget size, allowing a positioning bug to create an invisible, 2000px+ widget.
    -   **Solution:** Introduced `WidgetConstraints` with maximum width/height (`constants/ui.py`) and implemented size clamping in `PositionCalculator.calculate_position()` to ensure the widget always remains within safe, visible screen bounds.
    -   **Impact:** Prevents a catastrophic UX failure where the widget would disappear completely.

-   **Configuration Safeguards:** Hardened the config migration process to prevent silent failures and data loss.
    -   **Problem:** Invalid version strings in the config would cause migration logic to fail silently, risking user settings.
    -   **Solution:** Updated `_version_less_than()` to raise a custom `ConfigError`. The migration process (`_migrate_config()`) now catches this error, logs it, and safely resets the configuration to prevent corruption.
    -   **Impact:** Ensures user settings are safely migrated or reset, preventing silent data loss during upgrades.

### ✨ New Features

-   **Keep Widget Visible in Fullscreen (#107):** Added a new option (`keep_visible_fullscreen` in General settings) to keep the widget visible during fullscreen applications (e.g., games, F11 browser mode). This is disabled by default.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

-   **Graph & UI:**
    -   Removed a non-functional "Legend" toggle that could cause crashes in dual-graph mode. (#100)
    -   Fixed an issue where the graph settings panel would shrink when toggled. (#103)
    -   **Fixed Y-Axis Label Clipping:** Increased graph left-margin from 8% to 12% to prevent "Download" labels from being cut off on high-speed connections.
    -   **Corrected Graph Peaks:** Fixed a data mismatch where raw database spikes (pre-filtering) were incorrectly plotted despite being filtered from the text stats.
    -   Corrected widget positioning on high-DPI displays (125%/150%) to fix cumulative rounding errors. (#104)
    -   Fixed text truncation and misalignment when using the `short_unit_labels` setting. (#106)
-   **Multi-Monitor & Taskbar:**
    -   The widget can now be dragged freely across multiple monitors while in "free-move" mode. (#102)
    -   Added intelligent font scaling to improve readability on narrow vertical taskbars. (#99)

### 🌍 Localization

-   **Korean (ko_KR):** Updated with improved phrasing and technical terminology (Thanks @VenusGirl, PR #101).

### 🧪 Testing & Code Quality

-   **Massively Expanded Test Suite:** Added over **50 new unit tests** to lock in stability for critical systems.
    -   **Developer Experience:** Added `build-exe-only.bat` to the repository, allowing developers to quickly compile the standalone executable without the overhead of building the full setup installer.
-   **Positioning (`test_positioning_edge_cases.py`):** Added 20 focused tests covering ultrawide displays (21:9, 32:9), mixed-DPI transitions, multi-monitor boundaries, and extreme resolutions from 800x600 to 8K.
    -   **Configuration (`test_config.py`):** Added 7 new tests for version validation to prevent invalid or corrupt settings from being saved.
    -   **Widget Sizing:** Added 4 new tests to validate widget dimension constraints.
-   **Code Health & Refactoring:**
    -   Improved `PositionManager` for better maintainability.
    -   Extracted over 20 hardcoded rendering values to tunable constants in `RendererConstants`.
    -   Added a `threading.Lock` to the gradient cache in `GraphRenderer` to prevent race conditions.
    -   Refactored a nested function into a standalone `_process_plot_segment()` method for better testability.

*   **French (fr_FR):** Updated translation with corrections and improvements (Thanks @logounet for the contribution! #94)
*   **Multi-language Audit:** Synchronized and updated missing terms across all supported languages (Russian, Spanish, Dutch, Polish, Slovenian).

### 🏗️ Architectural Overhaul
*   **Modular Settings Architecture:** Decomposed the monolithic settings dialog into dedicated page classes (`AppearancePage`, `GraphPage`, etc.) located in a new `pages/` sub-package for significantly better maintainability.
*   **Core Logic Decoupling:** Extracted complex logic from `NetworkSpeedWidget` into specialized controllers:
    *   **`ConfigController`:** Now handles the entire settings lifecycle, including loading, saving, and rollbacks.
    *   **`InputHandler`:** Centralizes all mouse and keyboard events, separating user interaction from display logic.
*   **Adaptive Component Design:** Implemented a custom `AdaptiveStackedWidget` that allows the settings window to resize dynamically based on the current page's content.
*   **Throttled Configuration Engine:** Added a `QTimer`-based throttling mechanism to prevent redundant disk I/O when making rapid adjustments in the settings menu.

### 🎨 UI & UX Improvements
*   **Custom Arrow Styling:** Added granular control over arrow font family and size, independent of the speed value text.
*   **Settings Menu Streamlining:** Merged the standalone "Arrows" tab into the "Appearance" page, simplifying the navigation hierarchy (Visuals vs. Data rules).
*   **Modernized Mini-Graph:** Updated the widget's background graph to use a premium "Area Chart" style with gradient fills, smoother lines (antialiased), and improved Z-ordering (graph now properly sits behind text).
*   **Streamlined Interface Selection:** The specific interface list is now hidden by default to reduce visual clutter, automatically appearing only when "Select Specific Interfaces" is chosen.
*   **Enhanced Control Visibility:** Fixed rendering issues where radio buttons and checkboxes could become invisible in certain themes. Implemented custom, high-contrast circular styling for all radio buttons to ensure perfect visibility.
*   **Visual Polish:** Resolved transparency artifacts (black backgrounds) in the interface selection list.
*   **Adaptive Text Spacing:** Optimized the whitespace between arrows and speed values. Units like `MiB/s` now use tighter, cleaner spacing (3-digit reservation), while `Mbps` maintains a safe buffer for Gigabit speeds to prevent layout jitter.
*   **Windows 11 Slider Styling:** Updated all sliders to match the modern Windows 11 Fluent Design with thinner borders, precise handle sizing, and better hover states.
*   **Restored Speed Color Coding (#90):** Brought back full customization for color coding thresholds and colors in the Appearance settings.
*   **Smart Settings Auto-Resize:** The settings window now dynamically expands when toggling features and intelligently repositions itself upward if the expansion would go behind the taskbar on 1080p screens.
*   **Enhanced Font Weight Slider:** Replaced raw number inputs with a descriptive slider (e.g., "Regular", "Bold", "Extra Black") for easier configuration.

### 🧹 Maintenance & Logging
*   **Reduced Log Verbosity:** Demoted over 30 redundant initialization and routine cleanup messages from `INFO` to `DEBUG`, resulting in much cleaner and more readable log files.
*   **Architectural Polish:**
    *   **Shadowed Property Fix:** Renamed `self.font` and `self.metrics` to `self.current_font` and `self.current_metrics` to prevent internal conflicts with native `QWidget` methods.
    *   **Deduplication:** Removed a redundant second implementation of the mini-graph rendering logic.
*   **DRY Consolidation:** Centralized all timeline duration logic, aggregation thresholds, and resolution rules into `constants/data.py` to ensure consistency between the database layer and multiple UI components.
*   **Dead Code Cleanup:** Removed legacy startup registry logic from the main widget that was left over from recent architectural refactors.

### 🏎️ Performance & Reliability
*   **Critical Memory Leak Fix:** Resolved an issue where graph tooltips were creating orphan `QLabel` widgets on every timeline switch. Added explicit `deleteLater()` cleanup to prevent memory accumulation over prolonged sessions.
*   **Strict Rendering Caps:** Enforced a hard 800-point limit for all graph views (including 'Session'). The downsampling algorithm is now universally applied, preventing UI thread freezes during high-volume data rendering.
*   **Robust Date Handling:** Added failsafes around the plot date conversion loop to prevent renderer crashes even if data capping fails.
*   **Zero-Latency Interactions:** Implemented a dual-timer debouncing system (150ms for data updates, 500ms for configuration saves) that prevents UI "freezing" when rapidly adjusting sliders or filters.
*   **Intelligent Database Tier Selection:** Rewrote data retrieval to automatically select the most efficient single table (`raw`, `minute`, or `hour`) based on the requested time range, eliminating the overhead of complex `UNION ALL` queries for common views.
*   **Graph Caching & Smart Updates:** Implemented efficient in-place data updates for the "Live Session" graph, significantly reducing CPU usage during active monitoring.
*   **Improved Aggregation Accuracy:** Fixed a long-standing "binning shift" where data points in long-term views were forced to the start of their time window. Plot points are now rendered at the **mean timestamp** of their respective bins, providing a more accurate representation of the data.
*   **System Uptime Precision:** Resolved an issue where the "System Uptime" timeline showed inconsistent X-axis labels; it now correctly uses boot-time synchronization and high-precision locators.
*   **Obsolete Request Cancellation:** The background data worker now checks for newer request IDs and instantly skips processing for stale requests, ensuring the UI remains responsive under heavy interaction.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
*   **Startup Path Safety:** Fixed a critical issue where launching via Registry could fail due to incorrect working directory resolution (`cwd` correctness).
*   **Dev-Mode Protection:** Added safeguards to `startup_manager` to prevent development instances from accidentally overwriting production registry keys.
*   **Critical Font Crash Resolved:** Fixed a regression where interacting with the font selection dialog would crash the application due to a return-value swap (passing a boolean instead of a font object).
*   **Defensive Type Checking:** Added explicit `isinstance` checks and `try...except` blocks in the settings application layer to prevent future crashes from malformed configuration data.
*   **Widget Rendering Glitches:**
    *   **Hide Arrows (#84) & Unit Suffix (#86):** Fixed rendering logic that ignored these "Show/Hide" preferences in certain layout modes.
    *   **Font Style Visibility (#88):** Resolved a bug where changing font styles could cause the widget to disappear.
    *   **Font Weight Scaling (#89):** Added robust support for legacy string values (e.g., "bold", "normal") when loading weights from older configuration files.
*   **Positioning Stability:**
    *   **Free Move Snapping (#87):** Refined the "Free Move" logic to ensure the widget is correctly constrained to screen bounds.
    *   **Tray Offset (#92):** Validated and fine-tuned the widget's offset calculations relative to the system tray.
*   **Graph Settings Sliders (#93):** Replaced editable text boxes in graph settings with read-only labels for "Timeline" and "Retention" sliders to prevent invalid input.

*   **Background Bandwidth Calculation:** Moved heavy statistical summations to the data worker thread, preventing UI lag when calculating totals for massive datasets.
*   **Fixed "Stuck 0.00 Mbps" Bug (#64):** Lowered minimum display threshold to `0.0`. Meters now react to even the smallest background transfers (below 80kbps).
*   **Accuracy & Lag Resilience (#78):** Fixed timing logic and increased validity thresholds (3s -> 10s) to prevent inaccurate speed drops during minor system lag.
*   **Vertical Taskbar Support (#77):** 
    *   Changed layout to bottom-align the widget on vertical taskbars (placing it near the tray).
    *   Hardened Z-order preservation to ensure the widget stays on top even when the taskbar is clicked.
*   **Taskbar Detection Fixes (#75, #76):** Added safe screen fallbacks and silenced benign "ambiguous edge" log spam.
*   **Phantom Speed Spikes:** Corrected the rate-limiting math to prevent erratic behavior after system wake or intense jitter.

### 🏗️ Refactoring & Maintainability
*   **Tray Icon Manager:** Extracted system tray logic into a dedicated component.
*   **System Event Handler:** Centralized low-level Windows hooks (taskbar detection, fullscreen logic) for improved testability.
*   **Main Widget Decoupling:** Split the monolithic `NetworkSpeedWidget` by extracting `StartupManager` (registry logic) and enhancing `PositionManager` (Z-order/window control), significantly reducing code complexity.

### 🎨 UI & Customization
*   **Session View Default:** The graph now defaults to the high-resolution "Session" view, ensuring data is visible immediately upon opening.
*   **Widget Background:** Added custom background color and opacity controls.
*   **Short Unit Labels:** Added a toggle for compact unit display (e.g. "Mb" vs "Mbps").
*   **Precise Thresholds:** Replaced sliders with precise `QDoubleSpinBox` inputs (0-10,000 Mbps).

### 📐 Layout & Positioning

---

## [1.1.9] - December 31, 2025

This release addresses a critical bug where the widget would incorrectly hide when applications were maximized, even though the taskbar remained visible.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

*   **Fixed Widget Hiding with Maximized Apps:** Resolved issues where the widget would disappear when other applications were maximized.
    *   The `is_taskbar_obstructed` logic was overly aggressive and incorrectly identified maximized windows as obstructions.
    *   The detection has been simplified: the widget now only hides when a **true fullscreen application** is running (window dimensions exactly match the monitor).
    *   Maximized windows, borderless windowed games, and other non-fullscreen scenarios no longer cause the widget to hide.

### ⚙️ Build System

*   **Fixed Build Script:** Corrected a filename mismatch in `build.bat` where the expected installer filename did not include the `-x64` suffix, causing builds to fail at the packaging stage.

---

## [1.1.8] - December 11, 2025

This release marks a significant maturity milestone for NetSpeedTray. We are proud to announce that the application is now **digitally signed**, establishing a chain of trust and eliminating security warnings.

    *   Guarantees that the executable has not been tampered with since it left the build server.
*   **Security Patches:** Updated critical dependencies (including `fonttools` and `pandas`) to the latest secure versions to resolve reported vulnerabilities (CVEs).
*   **Hardened Build Process:** Implemented strict input sanitization in the GitHub Actions workflow to prevent script injection attacks.

### 🌍 Localization
*   **Russian Language Support:** Added complete translation for the Russian language (Русский).
*   **Locale Best Practices:** Updated the internal localization engine to use native language names (Endonyms) in the settings menu.

### 🤖 Automation & CI/CD
*   **Fully Automated Pipeline:** Implemented a robust CI/CD workflow using GitHub Actions. Every release is now built, tested, and packaged in a clean, isolated environment, ensuring 100% reproducibility.
*   **Automated Versioning:** The application version is now dynamically injected from Git tags directly into the executable, installer, and internal metadata. This ensures the "File Version" in Windows Properties always matches the release tag perfectly.
*   **Quality Gates:** Unit tests are now automatically executed before every build. If a test fails, the build is stopped immediately, preventing buggy releases from reaching users.

---

## [1.1.7] - October 29, 2025

This is a landmark release focused on stability and making the application's most complex feature—the **Network Speed Graph** - a fast, and visually insightful tool.

The graph has been completely re-architected for performance and clarity. This update also includes an extensive list of critical bug fixes that address phantom speed spikes, UI glitches, installer problems, and instability when the Windows shell is restarted.

### 🚀 Major Graph Window Overhaul

*   **Definitive Visualization:** The graph has been completely redesigned to solve the core problem of displaying asymmetric network speeds.
    *   **Dual-Axis Layout:** The graph is now split into two dedicated, independently-scaled charts for **Download** and **Upload**, ensuring that upload activity is always perfectly visible and not "flattened" by large download spikes.
    *   **Hybrid Rendering Engine:** The graph uses a smart, hybrid approach for visualization. Short timelines (e.g., "24 Hours") are rendered as detailed line plots, while long timelines (e.g., "Month") are rendered as a beautiful **Mean & Range Plot**, showing both the daily average trend and the min/max volatility.

*   **Massive Performance Improvements:** The entire data pipeline is now asynchronous, eliminating UI freezes.
    *   **Instantaneous Loading:** The graph window now opens instantly. Data is fetched and processed in a **background worker thread**, preventing the application from becoming unresponsive when loading large time ranges.
    *   **Responsive UI:** Switching between timelines, hovering over the graph, and resizing the window is now dramatically faster and smoother.

*   **Full Interactivity & Polish:**

    *   **NEW:** **Fixed Graph Timeline Display:** Solved multiple issues with the X-axis, including incorrect time windows being shown and cluttered, nonsensical timestamps. Timelines from 3-24 hours now have clean, sensible tick intervals.
    *   **NEW:** **Fixed Live Update Initialization:** Resolved a bug where the "Live Update" feature in the graph would not work on the first open, requiring the user to toggle it off and on again.
    *   **Fixed "No Data Available" Bug:** Resolved a critical bug in the database query logic that could cause the graph to incorrectly show "No data available."
    *   **Accurate Total Bandwidth:** Corrected the stats bar logic to ensure "Total" bandwidth calculations are fast and accurate across all timelines.
    *   **Visual Glitch Fixes:** Resolved bugs that caused Y-axis labels to appear in black on a dark background or display in scientific notation. Added a separator line for better clarity.

### 🛡️ Core Stability & Reliability

*   **Definitive Fix for "Phantom" Speed Spikes:** Implemented a new multi-stage "re-priming" state to permanently fix the bug where impossible network speeds would be recorded after the computer resumed from sleep or experienced heavy lag. The data collection engine now waits for the network drivers to stabilize before resuming measurements.
*   **Enhanced Shell & Display Resilience:** Fixed major bugs where the widget would disappear or move to the wrong position after `explorer.exe` was restarted, a monitor was disconnected (e.g., via a KVM switch), or on some multi-monitor setups. The application is now significantly more robust in detecting and recovering from these events.
*   **Fixed "Zombie" Process Bug:** Solved a critical issue where closing the graph window would also incorrectly close the main widget, leaving a lingering "zombie" process running in the background.
*   **Fixed Start Menu Shortcut:** Corrected a bug in the installer that prevented the Start Menu shortcut from being created on a fresh installation.
*   **Fixed "0 Mbps" Bug:** Fixed a logic error that caused the meter to show `0.00 Mbps` for users with a very fast `update_rate` by making internal timing checks dynamic and more robust.
*   **Fixed UI Glitches:**
    *   Resolved an issue where the widget would incorrectly move position after the user clicked the "Show hidden icons" tray chevron.

##  [1.1.6] - August 27, 2025

This version represents a major leap forward in stability, internationalization, and user control, addressing critical bugs from previous versions and fundamentally improving the application's architecture for future development.

### ✨ New & Reworked Features

-   **Full Internationalization (i18n) Framework:**
    -   The application has been completely re-architected to support multiple languages.
    -   **Modular Language Files:** All user-facing strings have been externalized from Python source code (`.py`) into language-specific JSON files (`locales/*.json`). This decouples translation from application logic, making it vastly easier for the community to add new languages or fix typos.
    -   **UX Improvement:** The language selection menu in the settings now correctly displays language names in their native form (endonyms), such as "Deutsch" instead of "German". This is a global best practice that prevents users from getting "trapped" in a language they cannot read.

-   **Overhauled Network Interface Monitoring:**
    -   The ambiguous "Monitor All Interfaces" option has been replaced with a clear, explicit set of four radio-button choices in the settings, giving users full control and transparency.
    -   **New Monitoring Modes:**
        1.  **Auto (Primary Interface):** The smart default that automatically finds the main internet-facing adapter.
        2.  **All Physical Interfaces:** Aggregates speed from hardware like Wi-Fi and Ethernet while intelligently filtering out virtual adapters (VPNs, VMs) to reduce noise.
        3.  **All Interfaces (including virtual):** A new power-user option that aggregates traffic from **every** adapter reported by the system, including VPNs, virtual machines, and system loopbacks.
        4.  **Select Specific Interfaces:** The existing manual selection mode.
    -   The core `NetworkController` logic was updated to support these new modes, applying the virtual interface exclusion list *only* when "All Physical" is selected.

### 🐛 Fixed & Stability Improvements

-   **Definitive Fix for Disappearing/Flickering Widget:**
    -   A fundamental issue in event handling, which caused the widget to disappear when interacting with the desktop, taskbar, or RDP sessions, has been resolved.
    -   **New Architecture:** The old, aggressive logic has been replaced with a **debounced refresh architecture**. The application now uses `WinEventHook` listeners to intelligently wait for system UI events (like window focus changes or resizes) to "settle" before performing a single, authoritative check on the widget's visibility and Z-order.
    -   This resolves all related stability issues, including the widget hiding when right-clicking for a context menu and correctly handles browser fullscreen videos.

-   **Database Aggregation Logic:**
    -   Fixed a bug in the SQL `GROUP BY` clause for both minute-to-hour and raw-to-minute data aggregation, ensuring that records are correctly combined and preventing duplicate entries in aggregated tables.

### 🏠 Architectural & Internal Improvements

-   **Constants Refactoring:** All user-facing strings were removed from the `constants` files and replaced with non-translatable keys. This improves code clarity and centralizes all text in the `locales` directory.
-   **Dependency Injection for i18n:** The internationalization object (`i18n`) is now properly initialized at the application entry point (`monitor.py`) and passed down as a dependency to all UI components (`widget`, `settings`, `graph`, `renderer`) and helper functions (`format_speed`).
-   **Test Suite Updates:** The `pytest` unit tests have been updated to reflect all architectural changes, including the new interface monitoring modes and the use of i18n keys, ensuring the application's logic remains sound.
-   **Installer Reliability:** The installer continues to gracefully shut down a running instance of the application before updating, preventing common installation errors.
-   **Improved Decimal Formatting UI:** The confusing "Force Decimals" toggle has been removed in favor of a single, intuitive slider that directly controls the number of decimal places (0, 1, or 2), with output now consistently padded with zeros for a more stable appearance.

## [1.1.5] - August 24, 2025 (Hotfix)

This is a critical hotfix release that provides a definitive and comprehensive fix for the startup crash and several related stability issues discovered during the beta cycle.

**This is a highly recommended update for all users.**

### 🐛 Fixed

-   **Critical Startup Crash & Systemic Stability Issues:** Resolved a complex chain of initialization and rendering errors that caused the application to crash on first launch, particularly on systems with specific UI configurations (like a small taskbar).
    -   Following user feedback from the beta releases (a huge thank you to GitHub user **[CMTriX](https://github.com/CMTriX)**!), a full codebase audit was performed.
    -   This audit eradicated a systemic typo pattern and fixed numerous latent bugs in the widget rendering, positioning, and various utility modules (`taskbar`, `network`, `config`).
    -   The result is a stable and reliable experience across a much wider variety of Windows environments.

### ✨ Improved

-   **Installer Reliability:** The installer is now much more robust when updating a running instance of NetSpeedTray. It now attempts a graceful shutdown of the application before proceeding with the update, preventing the "Setup was unable to automatically close all applications" error and ensuring a smoother, more successful update process.

---

## [1.1.4] - August 23, 2025 (Hotfix)

This is an immediate hotfix to address a critical bug in the "Start with Windows" feature introduced in v1.1.3.

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes

-   **Fixed "Start with Windows" Toggle:** Resolved a critical logic flaw where the "Start with Windows" setting could not be disabled. The toggle in the settings window will now correctly reflect the user's saved choice, and disabling the feature now correctly removes the application's entry from the Windows Registry.

---

## [1.1.3] - August 22, 2025 (Hotfix)

This is an urgent hotfix release that addresses a critical startup crash reported by users after the v1.1.2 update. It also restores and improves the widget's positioning stability, resolving several visual regressions.

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes & Stability Improvements

-   **Fixed Critical Startup Crash:** Resolved a critical `AttributeError` that prevented the application from launching on some systems. This was caused by an unreliable network dependency (`netifaces`) which has now been completely removed and replaced with a more robust, built-in solution.
-   **Restored Widget Stability (Fixed Flashing):** Re-engineered the widget's core update logic to eliminate a visual "flashing" regression introduced in v1.1.2. The widget is now perfectly stable and only updates its position when absolutely necessary, removing all polling-related flicker.
-   **Improved UI Responsiveness:** Fixed two key regressions where the widget would not:
    -   Reliably reappear after launching an application (like Calculator) from the Start Menu.
    -   Automatically reposition itself when new icons appeared in the system tray.

---

## [1.1.2] - August 22, 2025

This is a major stability and quality-of-life release that addresses critical bugs, enhances UI intelligence, improves user privacy, and completely overhauls the installer and settings backend for a more professional and robust user experience.

### ✨ Major Features & Improvements

-   **Intelligent Interface Monitoring (New Default):** The method for selecting network interfaces has been completely redesigned for clarity and accuracy.
    -   It now uses a clear, three-option radio button system: `All`, `Auto`, and `Selected`.
    -   **"Auto (Primary)" is the new default mode.** It intelligently identifies your main internet adapter, providing a much more accurate speed reading by ignoring noise from VPNs, virtual machines, and other virtual adapters.

-   **Language Selection:** The application is now fully internationalized. Users can select their preferred language from a new dropdown in the General settings. A restart is required for the change to take full effect.

-   **Intelligent Taskbar Positioning:** The widget's positioning logic has been completely re-architected. It now actively scans the taskbar for "obstacles" like the Start Menu, pinned application icons, and the Windows Weather/Widgets icon. It intelligently places itself in the nearest truly empty space, preventing it from overlapping with other UI elements.

-   **Adaptive Layout for Small Taskbars:** The widget now automatically detects when Windows' "Use small taskbar buttons" setting is active and switches to a clean, compact, single-line horizontal layout for a much better visual fit.

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes & Refinements

-   **Fixed "Auto" Interface Monitoring:** Fixed a critical bug where the "Auto" mode logic existed but was never actually called, making the feature non-functional. The controller now correctly uses this logic when the "Auto" mode is selected.
-   **Fixed Phantom Speed Spikes (Data Integrity):** Resolved a critical bug where waking the computer from sleep could cause the application to calculate and save impossibly high network speeds. The data collection logic is now more robust and includes multiple sanity checks to discard these "phantom" spikes.
-   **Fixed "Invisible Shield" & RDP Bugs (UI Stability):** Resolved a severe bug where the widget could act as an "invisible shield," blocking mouse clicks to other applications. The widget's transparent areas are now correctly "click-through" by default. This also resolves related stability issues for users in Remote Desktop (RDP) sessions.
-   **Fixed Graph Window Accuracy (Live Data):** Corrected a bug in the Graph Window where selecting a specific network interface would still display the total speed of all interfaces in "Live Update" mode. The graph now correctly displays only the selected interface's data.
-   **Fixed Settings Window Stability:** The Settings window has been re-engineered to be a normal, non-modal window. This fixes numerous UI bugs, including dropdown menus instantly closing and the entire application shutting down when the settings window was closed.
-   **Fixed Interface Selection Logic:** Corrected a logic flaw where monitoring would fall back to all interfaces if the "Selected" option was chosen but no interfaces were checked. It now correctly shows zero speed.
-   **Database & Data Integrity:**
    -   Fixed a bug where negligible, sub-byte network speeds were being incorrectly saved to the database.
    -   Resolved a `KeyError` crash that could occur during application shutdown due to a race condition in the timer management system.
-   **UI & Visual Polish:**
    -   The mini-graph on the widget now has dynamic Y-axis padding, preventing graph peaks from being "cut off".
    -   Fixed inconsistent decimal formatting for download speeds.

### ⚙️ Build System, Installer & Privacy

-   **Installer Overhaul:** The Inno Setup installer and uninstaller have been significantly improved:
    -   **Correct 64-bit Installation:** Ensured the installer correctly recognizes the application as 64-bit, defaulting to the native `C:\Program Files` directory instead of `C:\Program Files (x86)`.
    -   The uninstaller now reliably detects if the application is running and will prompt the user to close it before proceeding.
    -   The uninstaller now provides a clear option to completely remove all personal data (settings, database, logs).
    -   Fixed a bug where the desktop shortcut was sometimes left behind after uninstallation.
    -   Silent Uninstall with Data Removal: For a complete, unattended removal, run the following command in an **Administrator PowerShell**:
    ```powershell
    & "C:\Program Files\NetSpeedTray\unins000.exe" /SILENT /PURGE=true
    ```
-   **Log File Privacy (Verified):** The privacy filter is now fully effective. It automatically obfuscates personal information before it is written to the log file.
    -   User home directories in file paths are replaced (e.g., `C:\Users\Erez\...` becomes `<USER_HOME>\...`).
    -   IP addresses found in rare error messages are partially redacted (e.g., `192.168.1.100` becomes `192.168.x.x`).

This release focuses on providing a fast, and native-feeling user experience as much as possible. It introduces a major startup performance overhaul, addresses key bugs related to the history graph and UI integration, and refines the application's overall stability.

### ✨ Major Features & Improvements

-   **Drastically Improved Startup Performance:** The application's compiled structure has been changed to eliminate the slow, single-file unpacking process.
    -   **Faster Launch:** Startup time is now significantly faster, as the application and its dependencies are no longer extracted to a temporary folder on every launch.
    -   **New Distribution Formats:** To support this, NetSpeedTray is now distributed with a fast Inno Setup installer and a portable `.zip` archive for users who prefer a non-install option.
-   **Seamless UI Responsiveness & Integration:** The widget's visibility logic is now fully event-driven, eliminating delays and making it feel like a native part of the Windows shell.
    -   **Instantaneous Auto-Hide & Fullscreen Detection:** The widget now appears and disappears instantly with an auto-hiding taskbar and when entering or exiting fullscreen applications.
    -   **Graceful System UI Handling:** Proactively hides when core system menus (like the Start Menu and network/volume flyouts) are opened, and reappears upon closing them. This provides a polished, non-intrusive experience and avoids visual glitches.
    -   **Reliable Z-Order:** The widget now correctly stays on top of the taskbar and other applications after focus changes.
-   **Smart Taskbar Theme Detection:** Fixed a critical bug where the widget's text color would be incorrect for users with a "mixed theme" (e.g., Light app mode with a Dark taskbar). The widget now correctly bases its text color on the **taskbar's theme**, ensuring visibility in all configurations.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes & Refinements

-   **Graph Window Polish:**
    -   **Timeline Persistence:** The graph window now correctly remembers and restores the last selected time range (e.g., "6 Hours", "1 Day") across application restarts.
    -   **Corrected Data Display:** Fixed a bug where the graph would show "No data available" for long-term views on a fresh launch; it now correctly displays all available historical data.
-   **UI Visibility with Start Menu:** Resolved a regression where the widget would not reappear after launching an application (like Calculator or Settings) from the Start Menu.
-   **Light Mode Stability:**
    -   Fixed a crash that occurred when opening the Settings dialog in Windows Light Mode.
    -   Resolved the "invisible text" bug on the very first launch for users in Light Mode.
-   **Architectural Improvements:**

  - Refined fullscreen app detection to prevent widget hiding issues.

#### Known Issues

- **Multi-Monitor**: Limited to the primary taskbar’s screen; doesn’t fully support multiple taskbars or dynamic monitor changes without manual repositioning.
- **High-Frequency Updates**: May still impact performance on low-end systems despite throttling.
- **False Flagging** - [VirusTotal report](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/3c045c40ae2dd077fa66f5881649763b11b2584419f9e35b4421bee4f17fc3cf)

## [1.0.3] - March 1, 2025

### Bug Fixes

- **Startup Positioning Issue**: Resolved the issue where the `Widget` jumps to the top-left corner on startup after login, ensuring it maintains its exact saved position immediately.
- **Desktop Click Hiding/Flashing**: Fixed the issue where clicking the desktop causes the widget to hide and "flash", improving fullscreen detection and adding debouncing to prevent rapid visibility toggles.
- **Portable Startup Issue**: Fixed the "Start with Windows" option in the portable version, ensuring it creates a shortcut in the Startup folder for automatic launch on login, matching installed version behavior (requires `pywin32` for shortcut creation).

### Enhancements

- **Improved Widget Visibility and Z-Order Management**
  - Enhanced the widget’s visibility handling to ensure the widget remains visible across window switches and taskbar interactions.
- **Optimized Settings Dialog Positioning**
  - Streamlined the positioning of the settings dialog to use Qt’s screen geometry, ensuring it remains fully visible above the taskbar in multi-monitor setups, with better handling of size changes after saving settings.

### Known Issues

- **Start Menu Interaction Issue**

  - The `Widget` may hide or become unresponsive when the Windows Start menu is opened, This issue arises due to a Windows limitation where `Shell_TrayWnd` (the taskbar window) and related UI elements (e.g., Start menu) can obscure or temporarily disable overlay windows - like the widget.
  - Windows does not provide a reliable API or event to distinguish Start menu activation from other fullscreen or taskbar-related states, leading to potential misdetection in `is_fullscreen_app_active` or `check_and_update`. This behavior is outside NetSpeedTray’s control but may be mitigated in future updates by enhancing taskbar and Start menu state tracking.
  - What this all means to the avarage user - when clicking on the start menu, the widget 'hides' and when clicking anywhere other than the taskbar, it will reappear

  ### Detailed Bug Fixes (for those interested)

- **Enhanced Position Persistence**
  - Modified `NetworkSpeedWidget.initialize_with_saved_position` and `use_saved_position` to prioritize loading and applying the last saved position (`position_x`, `position_y`) from `netspeedtray.conf` on startup, ensuring the widget appears exactly where the user left it after each Windows logon.
  - Updated `update_position` to check for the `initial_position_set` flag and saved coordinates, defaulting to the last saved position unless explicitly overridden by dragging or major failures.
  - Improved error handling in `use_saved_position` and `update_position` to only fall back to position (100, 100) if there’s a critical failure (e.g., `taskbar_hwnd` or screen geometry cannot be detected). This prevents unnecessary repositioning to the top-left corner.
- **"Flashing" Prevention**:
  - Delayed widget visibility (`self.show()`) until `initialize_with_saved_position` confirms the correct position, avoiding premature display in the wrong location. This eliminates the "flashing" by ensuring smooth positioning before rendering.
  - Added logging in `initialize_with_saved_position` and `use_saved_position` to debug positioning issues, ensuring visibility of any errors causing the "flash" or incorrect placement.
- **Configuration Validation**:
  - Enhanced `load_config` and `validate_config` to ensure `position_x` and `position_y` are integers and within valid screen bounds, preventing corrupted or invalid position data from causing positioning errors.

## [1.0.2] - February 26, 2025

### Added

- **Startup Synchronization** Added command-line arguments (`--set-startup`, `--unset-startup`) to sync "Start with Windows" between the installer and app settings.

### Bugs Fixes

- **Invisible Widget Issue**: Resolved the issue where the app runs but the `Widget` remains invisible, ensuring proper display on the taskbar after launch, even after system restarts or environment changes (e.g., multi-monitor setups, fullscreen apps).
- **Dragging Error**:
  -Fixed and improving mouse event handling.

### Known Limitations

- **Multi-Monitor Support**
  - Supports multi-monitor setups by detecting the taskbar screen, but may experience positioning or sizing issues if monitors have different DPI scaling levels (e.g., 125%, 150%, 200%, 300%).
  - Handles resolution mismatches between monitors, but scaling mismatches can cause issues.
- **KVM Switches**
  - Should return to the correct position after switching via a KVM, but temporary mispositioning or scaling issues may occur if the new monitor setup differs (resolution, scaling, taskbar position).
- **Start Menu Interaction Issue**
  - The `Widget` may hide or become unresponsive when the Windows Start menu is opened, particularly on multi-monitor setups or with custom taskbar configurations. This issue arises due to a Windows limitation where `Shell_TrayWnd` (the taskbar window) and related UI elements (e.g., Start menu) can obscure or temporarily disable overlay windows like the widget.
  - Windows does not provide a reliable API or event to distinguish Start menu activation from other fullscreen or taskbar-related states, leading to potential misdetection in `is_fullscreen_app_active` or `check_and_update`. This behavior is outside NetSpeedTray’s control but may be mitigated in future updates by enhancing taskbar and Start menu state tracking.
  - Functionally - when clicking on the start menu, the widget 'hides' and when clicking anywhere but on the taskbar, it will reappear
- **Edge Cases**:
  - Multiple or docked taskbars, monitor hot-plugging, high DPI scaling on small monitors, fullscreen apps on non-taskbar monitors, low-performance systems, KVM switches to non-Windows OS, and custom taskbar positions may cause issues or misbehavior.

### Future Improvements

- Enhanced multi-monitor support with per-monitor DPI scaling awareness.
- Robust handling of KVM switches, monitor hot-plugging, and custom taskbar positions.
- Performance optimizations for low-end systems.
